# Offline Signature Verification System


## **Introduction**
This project implements an **Offline Signature Verification System** using Artificial Intelligence techniques. It employs image processing, feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms to differentiate between genuine and forged signatures. The system utilizes Gabor filters for feature generation and applies dimensionality reduction with PCA to train the model for high accuracy

## üéØ**Objectives**

1. Develop an AI-based solution to verify offline signatures with high accuracy.
2. Extract and analyze features to differentiate genuine signatures from skilled forgeries.
3. Employ supervised learning techniques to enhance the classification process.
4. Provide a scalable and efficient verification model for offline signature-based authentication.

## üöÄ**Features**
1.**Image Preprocessing**: Signatures are resized, normalized, and rotated for uniform processing.

2.**Feature Extraction**: Gabor filter banks capture directional features, and angles of stroke are analyzed box-wise.

3.**Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA reduces the feature space while retaining significant information.

4.**Classification**: The system uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to classify signatures as genuine or forged.

5.**Visualization**: Visual comparisons of feature vectors and normalized angles are provided for better understanding.

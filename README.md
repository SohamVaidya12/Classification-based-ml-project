## üèóÔ∏è**Workflow**

### 1. **Data Collection**
- Images of 10 different plant species were collected, each labeled appropriately in directories.  
- Each species corresponds to a unique folder containing its respective images.  

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- Images were resized to a uniform dimension of `(256x256x3)`.  
- Data normalization was applied to scale pixel values between 0 and 1.  
- Labels were encoded and converted into categorical one-hot representations.  

### 3. **Model Architecture**
- A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** was designed with the following key layers:  
  - **Conv2D Layers**: For feature extraction.  
  - **MaxPooling2D**: For down-sampling feature maps.  
  - **Dropout Layers**: To prevent overfitting.  
  - **Dense Layers**: For classification based on extracted features.  
  - Final activation as **Softmax** to predict probabilities for 10 classes.  

### 4. **Training**
- The model was trained over **150 epochs** with a batch size of **32** using the **Adam optimizer**.  
- `Categorical Cross-Entropy` was used as the loss function to handle multi-class classification.  

### 5. **Validation**
- The dataset was split into 80% training and 20% validation.  
- Validation accuracy and loss were monitored to ensure the model's generalizability.  

### 6. **Testing and Evaluation**
- Evaluated on a separate validation dataset to ensure high performance with real-world data.  

### 7. **Prediction**
- Tested the system with unseen images to predict the species accurately.  
- Outputs included class probabilities and corresponding species labels.

## **Conclusion**
The **Automated Plant Species Detection System** successfully demonstrates the potential of Deep Learning in tackling biodiversity challenges. By automating the plant species identification process, this project provides an efficient tool that minimizes manual effort and ensures high accuracy. The system is scalable and can be extended to classify additional plant species with further dataset augmentation.

This initiative not only underscores the integration of AI in agriculture and research but also paves the way for more innovative, data-driven solutions in biodiversity monitoring.
